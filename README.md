# Allowance and SmartContract are shared wallet contracts

Real-World Use-Case for this Project
• Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds.
• Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses.
• Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget.
Development-Goal
• Have an on-chain wallet smart contract.
• This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again.
• You can also give “allowance” to other, specific user-addresses.
• Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)
• Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent
